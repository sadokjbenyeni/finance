# History
The word Economy has a greek origins as it is composed of the two words: Oikos (Home) and Nomos (Laws) which means the good management of the house affairs and which also explains the "home economics" naming of a course that was taught in colleges prior to the modern personal finance.

In 1920 Hazel Kyrk was the first reasercher in the field at Chicago University laying down the first foundtions of the consumer econmics and family economics. Then with Margaret Reid a new concept was born which discusses the study of consumer behaviour.

Due to a limited educational resources, decision-maker wasn't able to make the best financial desicions, this was the conclusion make on 1947 by the Nobel laureate Herbert A Simon. In 2009, Dan Ariely confirmed the earliest idea by stressing the fact that financial descions are affected more by emotion than by common sens.

During the last 30 years several American Univesities started getting interested on the personal finance education for both undergraduate and graduate students. Conduct research was then published journals like The Journal of Financial Counseling and Planning. 

Since the beginning of this century, the term "financial literacy" has emerged to the audience. The standardization of the personal finance education has been taken seriously since the 2008 finacial crisis.
