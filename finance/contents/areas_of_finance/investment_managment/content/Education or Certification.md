# Education or Certification

At the undergraduate level, several business schools and universities internationally offer "Investments" as a subject within their degree; some universities, in fact, have formulated the title of 'Investment Management' or 'Asset Management' conferred as a specialist bachelor's degree.

Increasingly, those with aspirations to work as an investment manager, require further education beyond a bachelor's degree in business, finance, or economics.

Designations such as the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA), internationally, or the more local Chartered Investment Manager (CIM) in Canada, and the Certified International Investment Analyst (CIIA) in Europe and Asia, are increasingly required for advancement; even to gain entry level positions in the industry, enrollment / partial completion of exams is often helpful.

Further, a graduate degree - typically the MBA or MSF, or the more specialized Masters in Investment Management - may also be required for advancement to senior roles; and lately for entry level roles.

There is evidence that any particular qualification enhances the most desirable characteristic of an investment manager, that is, the ability to select investments that result in an above average (risk weighted) long-term performance.
