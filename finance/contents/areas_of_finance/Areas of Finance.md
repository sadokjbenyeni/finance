# Areas of Finance

As above, finance comprises, broadly, the three areas of personal finance, corporate finance, and public finance. Although they are numerous, other areas, such as investments, risk management, quantitative finance / financial engineering, and development finance typically overlap these; likewise, specific arrangements such as public–private partnerships.

## Personal finance

Personal finance is defined as "the mindful planning of monetary spending and saving, while also considering the possibility of future risk". Personal finance may involve paying for education, financing durable goods such as real estate and cars, buying insurance, investing, and saving for retirement. Personal finance may also involve paying for a loan or other debt obligations. The main areas of personal finance are considered to be income, spending, saving, investing, and protection. The following steps, as outlined by the Financial Planning Standards Board, suggest that an individual will understand a potentially secure personal finance plan after:

        - Purchasing insurance to ensure protection against unforeseen personal events;
        - Understanding the effects of tax policies, subsidies, or penalties on the management of personal finances;
        - Understanding the effects of credit on individual financial standing;
        - Developing a savings plan or financing for large purchases (auto, education, home);
        - Planning a secure financial future in an environment of economic instability;
        - Pursuing a checking and/or a savings account;
        - Preparing for retirement or other long term expenses.

## Corporate finance

Corporate finance deals with the actions that managers take to increase the value of the firm to the shareholders, the sources of funding and the capital structure of corporations, and the tools and analysis used to allocate financial resources. While corporate finance is in principle different from managerial finance, which studies the financial management of all firms rather than corporations alone, the concepts are applicable to the financial problems of all firms, and this area is then often referred to as “business finance”.

Typically "corporate finance" relates to the long term objective of maximizing the value of the entity's assets, its stock, and its return to shareholders, while also balancing risk and profitability. This entails three primary areas:
    1. Capital budgeting: selecting which projects to invest in - here, accurately determining value is crucial, as judgements about asset values can be "make or break"
    2. Dividend policy: the use of "excess" funds - are these to be reinvested in the business or returned to shareholders
    3. Capital structure: deciding on the mix of funding to be used - here attempting to find the optimal capital mix re debt-commitments vs cost of capital
The latter creates the link with investment banking and securities trading, as above, in that the capital raised will generically comprise debt, i.e. corporate bonds, and equity, often listed shares. Re risk management within corporates, see below.

Financial managers focus more on the short term elements of profitability, cash flow, and "working capital management" (inventory, credit and debtors), ensuring that the firm can safely and profitably carry out its financial and operational objectives; that it can service both maturing short-term debt repayments, and scheduled long-term debt payments , and has sufficient cash flow for ongoing and upcoming operational expenses.

## Public finance
 
Public finance describes finance as related to sovereign states, sub-national entities, and related public entities or agencies. It generally encompasses a long-term strategic perspective regarding investment decisions that affect public entities. These long-term strategic periods typically encompass five or more years.  Public finance is primarily concerned with:

    - Identification of required expenditures of a public sector entity;
    - Source(s) of that entity's revenue;
    - The budgeting process;
    - Debt issuance, or municipal bonds, for public works projects.
  
Central banks, such as the Federal Reserve System banks in the United States and the Bank of England in the United Kingdom, are strong players in public finance. They act as lenders of last resort as well as strong influences on monetary and credit conditions in the economy.

## Investment management

Investment management is the professional asset management of various securities in order to meet specified investment goals for the benefit of investors.

As above, investors may be institutions, such as insurance companies, pension funds, corporations, charities, educational establishments, or private investors, either directly via investment contracts or, more commonly, via collective investment schemes like mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, or REITs.

At the heart of investment management is asset allocation as appropriate to the client's investment policy, in turn, a function of risk profile, investment goals, and investment horizon: 
        - Portfolio optimization is the process of selecting the best portfolio given the client's objectives and constraints.
        - Fundamental analysis is the approach typically applied in valuing and evaluating the individual securities.
         
Overlaid is the portfolio manager's investment style and investment strategy. In a well-diversified portfolio, achieved investment performance will, in general, largely be a function of the asset mix selected, while the individual securities are less impactful. The specific approach or philosophy will also be significant, depending on the extent to which it is complementary with the market cycle.

A quantitative fund is managed using computer-based techniques (increasingly, machine learning) instead of human judgment. The actual trading also, is typically automated via sophisticated algorithms.

## Risk management

Risk management, in general, is the study of how to control risks and balance the possibility of gains; it is the process of measuring risk and then developing and implementing strategies to manage that risk. Financial risk management is the practice of protecting corporate value by using financial instruments to manage exposure to risk, here called "hedging"; the focus is particularly on credit and market risk, and in banks includes operational risk.

    - Credit risk is risk of default on a debt that may arise from a borrower failing to make required payments
    - Market risk relates to losses arising from movements in market variables such as prices and exchange rates
    - Operational risk relates to failures in internal processes, people, and systems, or to external events
  
Financial risk management is related to corporate finance in two ways. Firstly, firm exposure to market risk is a direct result of previous capital investments and funding decisions; while credit risk arises from the business' credit policy and is often addressed through credit insurance. Secondly, both disciplines share the goal of enhancing or at least preserving, the firm's economic value. See also "ALM" and treasury management. (Enterprise risk management, the domain of strategic management, addresses risks to the firm's overall objectives.)

For banks and other wholesale institutions, risk management focuses on hedging the various positions held by the institution - trading positions and long term exposures - and on calculating and monitoring the resultant regulatory- and economic capital under Basel IV. The calculations here are mathematically sophisticated, and within the domain of quantitative finance as below. Credit risk is inherent in the business of banking, but additionally, these institutions are exposed to counterparty credit risk.

Investment managers will apply various risk management techniques to their portfolios: these may relate to the portfolio as a whole or to individual stocks; bond portfolios are typically managed via cash flow matching or immunization. Re derivative portfolios (and positions), "the Greeks" is a vital risk management tool - it measures sensitivity to a small change in a given underlying parameter so that the portfolio can be rebalanced accordingly by including additional derivatives with offsetting characteristics.

## Quantitative finance

Quantitative finance includes those finance activities where a sophisticated mathematical model is required, and thus overlaps several of the above. As a specialized practice area, quantitative finance comprises primarily three sub-disciplines: 
    1. Quantitative finance is often synonymous with financial engineering. This area generally underpins a bank's customer-driven derivatives business — delivering bespoke OTC-contracts and "exotics", and designing the various structured products mentioned — and encompasses modeling and programming in support of the initial trade, and its subsequent hedging and management.
    2. Quantitative finance also significantly overlaps financial risk management in banking, as mentioned, both as regards this hedging, and as regards compliance with regulations and the Basel capital / liquidity requirements.
    3. "Quants" are also responsible for building and deploying the investment strategies at the quantitative funds mentioned; they are also involved in quantitative investing more generally, in areas such as trading strategy formulation, and in automated trading, high-frequency trading, algorithmic trading, and program trading.
