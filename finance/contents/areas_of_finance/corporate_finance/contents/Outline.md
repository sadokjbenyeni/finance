Increasing the shareholder value is the primary goal of financial management. This goal requires managers to be able to balance capital funding between investment in projects that are profitable and sustainable for the firm, while paying excess cash in form of dividends to shareholders. In order to helop the company grow and expand in the future the managers of growth companies uses a strategy that aims to use the surplus cash on investments and projecets. After reaching maturity in their field company with start using the surplus cash to payout dividends to shareholders. Managers must do an analysis to determine the appropriate allocation of the firm's capital resources and cash surplus between projects and payouts of dividends to shareholders, as well as paying back creditor related debt.

Choosing between investment projects will thus be based upon several inter-related criteria:
    - Corporate management seeks to maximize the value of the firm by investing in projects which yield a positive net present value when valued using an appropriate discount rate in consideration of risk.
    - If no growth is possible by the company and excess cash surplus is not needed to the firm, then financial theory suggests that management should return some or all of the excess cash to shareholders.

This "capital budgeting" is the planning of value-adding, long-term corporate financial projects relating to investments funded through and affecting the firm's capital structure.
 Management must allocate the firm's limited resources between competing opportunities (projects).

Capital budgeting divides projects according to their future potential and by which type of investment they will be financed. Investments should be made on the basis of value-added to the future of the corporation. Projects that increase a firm's value may include a wide variety of different types of investments, including but not limited to, expansion policies, or mergers and acquisitions. When no growth or expansion is possible by a corporation and excess cash surplus exists and is not needed, then management is expected to pay out some or all of those surplus earnings in the form of cash dividends or to repurchase the company's stock through a share buyback program.
