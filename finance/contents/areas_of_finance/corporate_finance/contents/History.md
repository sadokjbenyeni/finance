# History

The origins of corporate finance dates back to the 15th century in Italian city-states and low countries of Europe with the birth of the pre-industrial world.

In the 17th century the Dutch East India Company (also known by the abbreviation “VOC” in Dutch) gained both the title of the first publicly listed company ever to pay regular dividends and the first jount-stock company to get fixed capital stock.

By the early 1800s, London acted as a center of corporate finance for companies around the world, which innovated new forms of lending and investment. The twentieth century brought the rise of managerial capitalism and common stock finance, with share capital raised through listings, in preference to other sources of capital.

Modern corporate finance, alongside investment management, developed in both theory and practive in the second half of the 20th century, in the United States and Britain.
