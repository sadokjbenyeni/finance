# Relationship With Other Areas of Finance

# Investment banking
Use of the term "corporate finance" varies considerably across the world. In the United States it is used, as above, to describe activities, analytical methods and techniques that deal with many aspects of a company's finances and capital. In the United Kingdom and Commonwealth countries, the terms "corporate finance" and "corporate financier" tend to be associated with investment banking â€“ i.e. with transactions in which capital is raised for the corporation.

Risk management is the process of measuring risk and then developing and implementing strategies to hedge that risk. Financial risk management, typically, is focused on the impact on corporate value due to adverse changes in commodity prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates and stock prices. It will also play an important role in short term cash and treasury management. It is common for large corporations to have risk management teams; often these overlap with the internal audit function. While it is impractical for small firms to have a formal risk management function, many still apply risk management informally.

The discipline typically focuses on risks that can be hedged using traded financial instruments, typically derivatives; Foreign exchange hedge, Financial engineering. Because company specific, "over-the-counter" (OTC) contracts tend to be costly to create and monitor, derivatives that trade on well-established financial markets or exchanges are often preferred. These standard derivative instruments include options, futures contracts, forward contracts, and swaps; the "second generation" exotic derivatives usually trade OTC. Note that hedging-related transactions will attract their own accounting treatment.

This area is related to corporate finance in two ways: 
    1. Firm exposure to business and market risk is a direct result of previous capital financial investments. 
    2. Both disciplines share the goal of enhancing, or preserving, firm value. 

There is a fundamental debate relating to "Risk Management" and shareholder value. Per the Modigliani and Miller framework, hedging is irrelevant since diversified shareholders are assumed to not care about firm-specific risks, whereas, on the other hand hedging is seen to create value in that it reduces the probability of financial distress. A further question, is the shareholder's desire to optimize risk versus taking exposure to pure risk (a risk event that only has a negative side, such as loss of life or limb). The debate links the value of risk management in a market to the cost of bankruptcy in that market.
