# Personal finance principles

Personal finacial situation is binded to the income, wealth and consumption needs. Tax and finance laws are heavily affected by time and location. This means that a finacial strategy or advice must be personlized and specific for higher efficieny. But both professor **Harold Pollack** and **Helaine Olen** insists that no matter how many differences there are it finally comes down to six points:
    - Pay off your credit card balance every month fully
    - Save 20% of your income
    - Create an emergency fund
    - Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged funds such as a 401(k) retirement funds, individual retirement accounts, and 529 education savings plans
    - When investing savings:
        1. Don't attempt to trade individual securities
        2. Avoid high-fee and actively managed funds
        3. Look for low-cost, diversified mutual funds that balance risk vs. reward appropriately to your target retirement year
    - If using a financial advisor, require them to commit to a fiduciary duty to act in your best interest
