# The Components of a Financial System

There are mainly four components of the financial system:

    1. Financial markets - the market place where buyers and sellers interact with each other and participate in the trading of bonds, shares and other assets are called financial markets.
    2. Financial assets - the products which are traded in the financial markets are called financial assets. Based on different requirements and credit seekers, the securities in the market also differ from each others.
    3. Financial institutions - financial institutions are acting as a mediator between the investors and borrowers. They provide financial services for members and clients. It is also termed as financial intermediaries because they act as middlemen between the savers and borrowers. The investor's savings are mobilized either directly or indirectly via the financial markets. They offer services to organisations who want to raise funds from markets and take care of financial assets (deposits, securities, loan, etc).
    4. Financial services - services provided by assets management and liabilities management companies. They help to get the required funds and also make sure that they are efficiently invested. (eg. banking services, insurance services and investment services)
