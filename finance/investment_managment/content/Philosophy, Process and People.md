# Philosophy, Process and People
The 3-P's (Philosophy, Process, and People) are often used to describe the reasons why the manager is able to produce above average results.

    - Philosophy refers to the overarching beliefs of the investment organization. For example:
      - Does the manager buy growth or value shares, or a combination of the two (and why) ?
      - Do they believe in market timing (and on what evidence) ?
      - Do they rely on external research or do they employ a team of researchers? It is helpful if any and all of such fundamental beliefs are supported by proof-statements.
  
    - Process refers to the way in which the overall philosophy is implemented. For example: 
      - Which universe of assets is explored before particular assets are chosen as suitable investments ?
      - How does the manager decide what to buy and when ? 
      - How does the manager decide what to sell and when ?
      - Who takes the decisions and are they taken by committee ?
      - What controls are in place to ensure that a rogue fund (one very different from others and from what is intended) cannot arise ?
  
    - People refers to the staff, especially the fund managers. For example: 
      - Who are they ? 
      - How are they selected ? 
      - How old are they ? 
      - Who reports to whom ? 
      - How deep is the team (and do all the members understand the philosophy and process they are supposed to be using) ? 
      - And most important of all, How long has the team been working together ?
