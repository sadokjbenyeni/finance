# Investment Managers and Portfolio Structures
At the heart of the investment management industry are the managers who invest and divest client investments.
A certified company investment advisor should conduct an assessment of each client's individual needs and risk profile. The advisor then recommends appropriate investments.

## Asset allocation
The different asset class definitions are widely debated, but four common divisions are stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities. The exercise of allocating funds among these assets is what investment management firms are paid for. Asset classes exhibit different market dynamics, and different interaction effects; thus, the allocation of the money among asset classes will have a significant effect on the performance of the fund. Some research suggests that allocation among asset classes has more predictive power than the choice of individual holdings in determining portfolio return. Arguably, the skill of a successful investment manager resides in constructing the asset allocation, and separate individual holdings, so as to outperform certain benchmarks (e.g., the peer group of competing funds, bond, and stock indices).

## Long-term returns
It is important to look at the evidence on the long-term returns to different assets, and to holding period returns. For example, over very long holding periods in most countries, equities have generated higher returns than bonds, and bonds have generated higher returns than cash. According to financial theory, this is because equities are riskier than bonds which are themselves more risky than cash.

## Diversification
Against the background of the asset allocation, fund managers consider the degree of diversification that makes sense for a given client and construct a list of planned holdings accordingly. The list will indicate what percentage of the fund should be invested in each particular stock or bond. The theory of portfolio diversification was originated by Markowitz. Effective diversification requires management of the correlation between the asset returns and the liability returns, issues internal to the portfolio, and cross-correlations between the returns.
