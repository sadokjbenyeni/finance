# Working Capital Management

Working capital management refers to managing the relationship between short-term assets and short-term liabilities therefore sustaining ongoing bussiness operations.

In the long term, capital budgeting, firm value is enganced through appropriately selecting and funding NPV positive investments, which have in terms influence cash flow and cost of capital. The goal of working capital management is to ensure the possesion of sufficient funds for the company to operate in the short term and that it has sufficient cash flow to operate long-term debt and to satisfy both maturing short-term debt and upcoming operational expenses. In so doing, firm value is enhanced when, and if, the return on capital exceeds the cost of capital. working capital mannager is in our modern day language called the CFO.

## Working capital

Working capital is the amount of funds that are necessary for an organization to continue its ongoing business operations, until the firm is reimbursed through payments for the goods or services it has delivered to its customers. Working capital is measured through the difference between resources in cash or readily convertible into cash, and cash requirements.

The (short term) goals of working capital are therefore not approached on the same basis as (long term) profitability, and working capital management applies different criteria in allocating resources: the main considerations are cash flow / liquidity and  profitability / return on capital.

The most widely used measure of cash flow is the net operating cycle, or cash conversion cycle. This represents the time difference between cash payment for raw materials and cash collection for sales. The cash conversion cycle indicates the firm's ability to convert its resources into cash. Because this number effectively corresponds to the time that the firm's cash is tied up in operations and unavailable for other activities, management generally aims at a low net count.
In this context, the most useful measure of profitability is return on capital (ROC). The result is shown as a percentage, determined by dividing relevant income for the 12 months by capital employed; return on equity (ROE) shows this result for the firm's shareholders. As above, firm value is enhanced when, and if, the return on capital exceeds the cost of capital.

## Management of working capital

Guided by the above criteria, management will use a combination of policies and techniques for the management of working capital.These policies aim at managing the current assets (generally cash and cash equivalents, inventories and debtors) and the short term financing, such that cash f lows and returns are acceptable.

    - Cash management. Identify the cash balance which allows for the business to meet day to day expenses, but reduces cash holding costs.
    - Inventory management. Identify the level of inventory which allows for uninterrupted production but reduces the investment in raw materials – and minimizes reordering costs – and hence increases cash flow. See discussion under Inventory optimization and Supply chain management. Note that "inventory" is usually the realm of operations management: given the potential impact on cash flow, and on the balance sheet in general, finance typically" gets involved in an oversight or policing way".
    - Debtors management. There are two inter-related roles here: 
      1. Identify the appropriate credit policy, i.e. credit terms which will attract customers, such that any impact on cash flows and the cash conversion cycle will be offset by increased revenue and hence Return on Capital.
      2. Implement appropriate credit scoring policies and techniques such that the risk of default on any new business is acceptable given these criteria.
    - Short term financing. Identify the appropriate source of financing, given the cash conversion cycle: the inventory is ideally financed by credit granted by the supplier; however, it may be necessary to utilize a bank loan (or overdraft), or to "convert debtors to cash" through "factoring"; see generally, trade finance.
